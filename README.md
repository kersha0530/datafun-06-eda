# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Seaborn's Exercise Dataset

##  Project Overview
**Author:** Kersha Broussard  
**Date:** February 12, 2025  
**Dataset:** Seaborn's `exercise` dataset  

## üîç Purpose of the Project
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn**. The goal is to understand the relationships between different exercise activities, heart rate, and diet.

### **Project Objectives:**
- Load and explore the dataset (shape, structure, and data types)
- Perform initial descriptive analysis (summary statistics, missing values)
- Visualize distributions of numerical and categorical variables
- Examine trends and relationships between key variables
- Transform data and engineer new features where necessary
- Summarize findings with meaningful insights

##  Getting Started
### **1Ô∏è. Install Required Libraries**
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

### **2Ô∏è. Open Jupyter Notebook**
Launch Jupyter Notebook from your project folder:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `exercise_eda.ipynb` to follow the analysis.

### **3Ô∏è. Load the Dataset**
The dataset is loaded directly from Seaborn:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = sns.load_dataset("exercise")

# Drop unwanted column
df.drop(columns=["Unnamed: 0"], inplace=True)
```

##  **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
### **1Ô∏è. Check Data Structure**
```python
print(df.head(10))  # First 10 rows
print(df.shape)      # Dataset dimensions
print(df.dtypes)     # Column data types
print(df.describe()) # Summary statistics
```

### **2Ô∏è. Handling Categorical & Numerical Data**
- **Convert time column to numeric:**
```python
df["time_numeric"] = df["time"].str.extract(r"(\d+)").astype(float)
```
- **Rename pulse column for clarity:**
```python
df.rename(columns={"pulse": "heart_rate"}, inplace=True)
```
- **Create a new activity level column:**
```python
df["activity_level"] = df["time_numeric"].apply(lambda x: "Short" if x == 1 else ("Moderate" if x == 15 else "Long"))
```

## üìä **Visualizations & Insights**
### **1Ô∏è. Distribution of Exercise Durations**
```python
sns.histplot(df["time_numeric"], bins=3, kde=True)
plt.xlabel("Time (minutes)")
plt.title("Distribution of Exercise Duration")
plt.show()
```

### **2Ô∏è. Heart Rate Distribution by Exercise Type**
```python
sns.boxplot(x="kind", y="heart_rate", data=df)
plt.title("Heart Rate Distribution by Exercise Type")
plt.xlabel("Exercise Type")
plt.ylabel("Heart Rate (bpm)")
plt.show()
```

### **3Ô∏è. Heart Rate Trends Over Time by Exercise Type**
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.lineplot(x="time_numeric", y="heart_rate", hue="kind", marker="o", data=df)
plt.title("Heart Rate Trend Over Exercise Duration")
plt.xlabel("Exercise Duration (minutes)")
plt.ylabel("Heart Rate")
plt.legend(title="Exercise Type")
plt.show()
```

##  **Key Takeaways:**
- **Heart rate increases** with longer exercise durations.
- **Running** has the highest heart rate on average.
- **People on a low-fat diet** tend to have a slightly lower heart rate during exercise.

### **Why This Matters?**
Understanding exercise trends helps in making better fitness and health decisions. This analysis can assist in:
- Identifying patterns in heart rate during exercises.
- Observing the impact of diet on exercise performance.
- Understanding activity levels over time.
